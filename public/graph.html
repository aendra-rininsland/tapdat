				<h2>Ed Miliband, Leader of the Opposition (Labour Party)</h2>
				<p>Ed Miliband has been an MP for Doncaster North since 2005 and won the battle for leadership of the Labour party against his brother, David Miliband, in 2010 by 1.3 per cent. He was preceded by Harriet Harman. 
				His critics characterise him as weird and geeky and his supporters praise Labourâ€™s initiatives to undo Conservative measures, such as the mansion tax and their pledge to reduce tuition fees.</p>

				<h2>Nick Clegg, Deputy Prime Minister (Liberal Democrats)</h2>
				<p>He has been Deputy PM and Lord President of the Council as part of his coalition government, formed with Conservative PM David Cameron in 2010. Clegg has been leader of the Lib Dems since 2007 and an MP for Sheffield Hallam since 2005. His critics will not forgive him for forming a coalition with the Tories who raised university tuition fees, after pledging not to. His supporters praise him for his passionate, charismatic persona.</p>

				<h2>Nigel Farage (UKIP)</h2>
				<p>UKIP have risen to prominence like never before under Nigel Farage, who has been its leader since 2010. He was a founding member of UKIP, having left the Conservative Party in 1992 after signing the Maastricht Treaty.
				He has been an MEP for South East England since 1999.  His critics brand his policies on the EU and immigration as racist and xenophobic and his supporters praise such policies as tough and pragmatic, much like his pint-drinking.</p>

				<h2>Natalie Bennett (Green Party of England and Wales)</h2>
				<p>The Australian-born politician and journalist was elected as leader of the Green Party of England and Wales in September 2012. In February this year, she gave an interview about the funding of house-building with LBC which was deemed "absolutely excruciating" and one of the worst political interviews ever. In January, Ofcom ruled to exclude the Greens from the tv debates, which she contested, resulting in an upsurge in party support. Her supporters respect her dedication to the environment and her critics brand the Greens as a one-cause party.</p>

				<h2>Nicola Sturgeon, First Minister of Scotland (SNP)</h2>
				<p>Sturgeon is the fifth First Minister of Scotland and leader of the Scottish National Party and is the first woman to hold either position. She was preceded by Alex Salmond, who left following the defeat of the Yes Scotland campaign in the 2014 independence referendum. Sturgeon represents Glasgow Southside as its MSP 
				Her critics brand her her a one-trick pony and her supporters praise her for taking a more conciliatory tone than Salmond while still remaining dedicated to Scotland.</p>

				<h2>Leanne Wood (Plaid Cymru)</h2>
				<p>Wood has represented the South Wales Central region as a Member of the National Assembly for Wales since 2003 and was elected leader of Plaid Cymru in 2012. She is a socialist, republican and proponent for Welsh independence as well as being the first female leader of Plaid Cymru and the first party leader to be a non-native rather than native speaker of Welsh. Her supporters praise her for leading the exposure of excess at the Welsh Audit Office between 2009 and 2011, which she did via the Freedom of Information Act. Her critics disagree with her belief that Wales would be an independent sovereign state within a generation, and would exist within a "Neighbourhood of Nations", following the break-up of the United Kingdom.</p>
